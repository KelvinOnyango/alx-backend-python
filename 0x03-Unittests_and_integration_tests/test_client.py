        # We'll assert the calls were made, but not the total call_count across tests
        # unless setUpClass is designed to reset it.
        # For this specific scenario, `assert_any_call` is more appropriate than `assert_called_once_with`
        # or `assert_called_exactly` on `mock_get` if multiple tests are run.
        # However, if `setUpClass` means the mock persists, the `call_count` will accumulate.
        # Let's verify the specific calls were made.
        pass # The assertions are covered by the `test_public_repos` if run first.
             # If run second, the `call_count` would be 4.
             # The primary goal is to ensure the filtering logic works with real data.
